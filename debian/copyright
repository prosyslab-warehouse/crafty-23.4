On Thu 14. Mai 22:13:48 CEST 2009 autobuilding was requested 
by Oliver Korff <ok@xynyx.de> of nonfree@release.debian.net, 
this is the mail snippet:

...
I would like to request autobuilding crafty. The licence is strictly non-free, 
but we have the explicit written permission to redistribute of the upstream 
author.

I have had contact with him recently and am convinced that the reason for 
making it non-free, is the code abuse in computer chess tournaments as 
mentioned in the copyright file.

We also do not alter craftys name or copyright notice, so everything that 
matters to the upstream author stays intact. Autobuilding does not interfere 
with that.

Does this copyright mean Crafty cannot be redistributed by the usual
Debian CD redistributors?  Well, I asked Prof. Hyatt this exact
question via e-mail.  The conversation was as follows:

not a problem with me at all...

no...  I simply don't want someone to market crafty as a chess program.
Including it with something else is fine, knowing that there will be
newer (and better) versions for free on my ftp machine anyway.  I put
that restriction in because there was a company that was making waves
about "Crafty is just too strong to be free, we are going to modify it
a little and then sell it..."
